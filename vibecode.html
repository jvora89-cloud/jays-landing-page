        <p>VibeCode is Riley Brown's vision for the future of software development—a platform that makes building mobile applications as intuitive as design, as accessible as conversation.</p>

            <p><strong>The Canva for Coding</strong></p>
            <p>Just as Canva democratized graphic design, VibeCode is democratizing app development through AI-powered creation.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The platform recently raised $9 million in funding, validating Riley's belief that the future of programming isn't about writing code—it's about communicating intent. VibeCode transforms natural language into functional applications, allowing creators to build what they imagine without years of technical study.</p>

        <p><strong>What is Vibe Coding?</strong></p>

        <p>Vibe coding is a revolutionary approach to software development where AI generates code instead of humans writing it manually. Unlike traditional programming that requires extensive training, vibe coding leverages AI's ability to understand natural language and convert ideas into functional applications within minutes.</p>

        <p>This methodology uses AI programs like Claude, Cursor, and other cutting-edge tools to create games, simulations, web pages, and mobile applications. The focus shifts from syntax and structure to vision and intent.</p>

        <p><strong>The Mission</strong></p>

        <p>Riley hopes VibeCode inspires creators to launch apps for their audiences by making the process truly accessible. His philosophy: "I think one of the reasons why people don't get deep into computer science is they don't get hit with the 'aha' moment soon enough."</p>

        <p>VibeCode aims to deliver that moment immediately, empowering anyone with an idea to bring it to life.</p>
