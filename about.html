        <p>Riley's approach to AI is fundamentally different. He believes that the barrier to entry in computer science is too high, and that most people never experience the "aha" moment that makes programming click. Through vibe coding, he's changing that narrative.</p>

        <p>His work has been featured across major platforms, and he continues to push the boundaries of what's possible when AI and human creativity intersect.</p>
